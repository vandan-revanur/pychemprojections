### Pull Request Process

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b <branch_name>`.
3. Format your code with the [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) package.
4. Make your changes and commit them.
Use the [conventional-commits format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
A good and easy way to do this is to install commitizen tool.

For the non-interactive CLI version look [here](https://github.com/streamich/git-cz).
4. Update the README.md with details of changes.
5. Increase the version number and generate changelog using commitizen : `cz bump --changelog`. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. Push to the remote branch: `git push`
5. Create the pull request.
